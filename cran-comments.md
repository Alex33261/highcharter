## Resubmission 

- Removing invalid URLs from the documentacion.
- The example of `hc_theme_538` function takes more than 10s because various
related function are using the same man file. 
- Adding `if(interactive())` to example for the `checking for detritus in the temp directory`
based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62456137/r-cran-check-detritus-in-temp-directory.

## Previous resubmission
