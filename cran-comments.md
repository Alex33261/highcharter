## Updating the package

* Uploading to 0.5.0 (previous 0.4.0)

* In the __check__ I have some __NOTE__s due:
  
  * The size of the htmlwidgets folder (1.8Mb). I can't remove because are 
  required javascript files to highcharts library.
  * The size of the vignette (13.7Mb). The _charting maps_ vignette load a 
  lot of differents maps to make examples.
